In this assignemnet, I will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset that catalogs the microbes that colonize in human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTU, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
